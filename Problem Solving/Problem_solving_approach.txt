What is an Algorithm? 
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task


Step 1: Understand the problem 

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words ? 
2. What are the input that go into the problem ? 
3. What are the outputs that should come from my soultion ? 
4. Can the outputs be determinded from the inputs ? 
5. How should I label the importnatn peices of data that are a part of the problem ? 


Step 2: Explore Examples 

1. Start with simple examples 
2. Progress with more complex examples 
3. explore Examples with Empty Inputs 
4. Explore with invalid inputs 


Interviewer says: Write a function that takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string 

charCount('aaaa') - Should this return {a:4}  // SImple example
charCount('Hello Worldh') - should this return {H:1,e:1, l:3, o: 2, W:1, r:1, d:1, h:1} //complex example 
charCount('') - since there is no input what do we want to return? An empty object? Null? undefined? // No input
charCount({a:null}) - since this is an invalidinput what do we want to return? // Invalid Input

MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK.
Are we accounting for spaces? 
Are we countings numbers also? 
Are upper and lowercase letters the same ? 

Step 3: Break it down (writing out the steps you will take)

- Doenst have to be sudo code of 100% how to soleve it , just simply layout steps

For example: 
Interviewer says: "Write a function that takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string in an object. 
Make all letters lowercase and only count for AlphaNumeric (Int/Letters)" 

Me : Let me break the problem down in its simplest form. 

function charCount(str) {
    //make the object that needs to be returned 
    // loop over each character in the string 
    // return the object with the expected values 
}

Me: Now let me break it down in a more complex detailed way

function charCount(str) {
    //make the object that needs to be returned 
    // loop over each character in the string
        // if the character is already accounted for add 1  
        // if the charcetesd is not accounted for yet set that charcted as the key and the value as 1 
    // return the object with the expected values 
}

Step 4: Refactor

Questions to ask after I have a soultion

- Can I imporve the performance of your soultion? 
- Can you understadn it at a glance? 



Here Im going to take what I learned and apply it to some simple problems 

IMW = In my words 

Excersize: Write a function that takes a string as input and retunrs the string reversed. 

IMW : take a string and return it reveersed. 

Simple example - reverseStr('Armoni') ---> output 'inomrA'
Complex example - 


// Always will be an input
// input will always be a valid string 

const reverseStr = (str) => {
    // var that holds the reveersed string
    const reverseStr = []
    // go thorugh each letter in the OG string 
       //loop through each character starting from the end and add it to the var that holds reversed string
   for(let i = str.length - 1; i <= 0 ; i--){
        reverseStr.push(str[i])
   }
    //turn reverseStr into a string 
    return reverStr.join(")
    // return reveresd string
}

str = 'Armoni' 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excersize: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array. 

IMY: return the largest number in the array 

simple example: [1,2,3,4,5] --> 5 (int)

Will the array always only contain ints? --->  Yes 
Will the array always have values? ---> yes 

function largestNum(arr) {
    //initalize a var to store the largest value
        let largestCurrentValue = arr[0]
    //loop through the array to find the largesst value
      for(let i = 1 ; i < arr.length; i++){
            if(largestCurrentValue < arr[i] ){ 
                    largestCurrentValue = arr[i]
            } 
      }
        // store the largest value as its looping and compare it with the next value
           
    
    // once I have finished looping through each value return the largest value
    return largestCurrentValue
}
arr = [-1,-2,0,-4,5]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excersize: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a,e,i,o,u) in the string 

IMY: return the number of vowels in a string
simple example : vowels('Rick') ---> return 1(int)

Is 'y' included in the vowls list? No only a,e,i,o,u
will the string alwyas contain letters? Yes it will alwys contain letters 
if the string is empty shoudl i return zero also?  Yes

function vowels(str){
    //set an array that contains the vowels
        const vowels = [a,e,i,o,u]
    //set a counter to zero 
        const counter = 0
    // make each letter lowercase
        const stringToLowerCase = str.toLowerCase()
    //loop through each letter in str to compare with vowels array
        //i will need to stay the same value until j has looped through each vowels
        for(let i = j = 0; i < str.length; j++){
            if(str[i] === vowels[j]){
                counter++
                j = 0
                i++
            }else if(j === vowels.length){
                i++
                j=0
            }
           
        }
        // if a match is found incremnt counter by 1
    //once the loop is finished return counter
    return counter

}

str = 'did'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excersize: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of 3 printe "Fizz 
intead of the number and for multiples of 5 print "buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three
and five print FizzBuzz

IMY: if a number is divsible by 3 print fizz. Divisible by 5 print buzz. divisble by both print FizzBuzz
 else print the number

example fizzBuzz(5) -> 1,2,fizz,4,buzz

will the input alwasy be an integer? ---> yes 
what if there is no input? 

const fizzBuzz = (num) =>{
    //loop up to param num
    for(let i = 1; i <= num;i++){
        if(num % 3 && num % 5 === 0){
            console.log('FizzBuzz')
        }else if(num % 3 === 0){
            conosle.log('Fizz')
        }else if(num % 5 === 0){
            console.log('Buzz')
        }else{
            console.log(num)
        }
    }
    //if divisbile by 3 & 5 log fizzbuzz
    //if num divisible by 3 log fizz
    //if num divisble by only 5 log buzz
    //else just log the number
}
