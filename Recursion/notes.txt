A man is given a task by a wizard 
His task is to take a list of numbers to a dragon to see if there are any odd numbers in the list

The man takes the list to the dragon and the dragon say that he will only look at the first number in the list. 

The man decides to take the list to the dragon once every 10 minutes

On the first visit, the Dragon looks at the list (2,200,98,76)
the Dragon only looks at the first item of the list , in this case its 2. 
    The Dragon says 2 is not odd 

On the second visit the Dragon looks at the list (200,98,76)
    The Dragon says 200 is not odd 
On the third visit the Dragon looks at the list (98,76)
    The Dragon says 98 is not odd 
On the forth visit the Dragon looks at the list (76)
    The Dragon says 76 is not odd
On the 5th visit the Dragon looks at the list()
    The Dragon looks at the man can call him an idiot for bringing him and empty list 

In the end the man returned the list to the Wizard. The man told the wizrds that the list contained no odd numbers.

This is recursion 
The end...

What is Recursion? 
- A function the calls itself

Where does recusrion happen? 
- JSON.parse/ JSON.stringify
- document.getElementById 
- Object traversal

A call stack 
    A stack is a data structure! 

    Anytime a function is invoked it is placed(pushed) on the top of the call stack 

    When javascript see the return keyworkd or when the function ends, the complier will remove(pop)
    the function from the call stack 


Base Case 
    Where the recursion stops/ends.


Helper method recursion
